			<p>Mr. Danny B, born Daniel Botello, has worked many and much a magic for the 35 years of walking this mortal plane. Friends know him for his laugh and caring ear. Enemies know him for his creative strategems and his devilish good looks. Business partners know him as a driven, charismatic otter who can't quite sit still, and has a solution already brewing.</p>
			<br>
			<p>This otter never sits still in engaging ways. If you would like a juggler or dancer, he's on the case. If you need a problem solver, he's packing a cadre of ideas to choose from. If you need some advice, his ears and heart stand at attention.</p>
